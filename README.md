# DAO-Ghorants: Streamlining Transparent Grant Processes with ChatGPT

DAO-Ghorants is a project dedicated to enhancing the grant processes within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). By leveraging blockchain technology and incorporating ChatGPT, this platform allows DAOs to seamlessly create, evaluate, and distribute funds transparently.

## Features

- **Automated Grant Submissions:** Simplify the grant submission process by automating various steps, making it easy for applicants to submit proposals.

- **Transparent Evaluation:** Utilize smart contract-based criteria and integrate ChatGPT for transparent evaluation of grant proposals. This ensures a fair and decentralized decision-making process.

- **Efficient Fund Distributions:** Upon approval, execute seamless fund distributions using blockchain technology, enhancing efficiency and transparency in fund management.

## Tech Stack for DAO-GHO Prizes

### Technologies Used:

1. **TypeScript/Node:**

   - **Role:** Primary development stack for server-side logic and enhanced code maintainability.

2. **Solidity for Smart Contracts:**

   - **Role:** Language dedicated to Ethereum smart contracts, ensuring secure and efficient contract logic.

3. **GitHub Sign-in Integration:**

   - **Role:** Authenticates users via GitHub, linking grant proposals directly to GitHub identities.

4. **ChatGPT (OpenAI):**
   - **Role:** Integrated for human-like project evaluations, covering key aspects like creativity, use of blockchain, impact, collaboration, and reliability.

### Integration and Synergy:

- **GitHub and Smart Contracts:**

  - Ensures authenticity by tying grant proposals to the developer's GitHub identity.
  - Smart contracts manage GHO prize deployment and distribution seamlessly.

- **ChatGPT and Evaluation Process:**
  - Enhances evaluation with human-like responses, providing deep insights into grant proposals.

### Key Features:

- **Plagiarism Detection:**

  - The project incorporates a plagiarism detection system, assigning a score from 0 to 100 to each submission. A score of 75 or above allows the DAO to consider approving the grant, adding an additional layer of evaluation.

- **Streamlined Grant Submission:**

  - GitHub sign-in integration streamlines the grant submission process, making it user-friendly and ensuring that only authentic proposals tied to GitHub repositories are accepted.

- **Innovative Evaluation with ChatGPT:**
  - The use of ChatGPT in the evaluation process provides a novel and efficient way to assess grant proposals, enhancing the objectivity and depth of the evaluation.

### Future Considerations:

- Continuous refinement of ChatGPT-based evaluation.
- Ongoing improvements to the user interface for an intuitive grant creation process.
- Adding ZK proofs for enhanced privacy and security.
- Delegate DAO funds delegation to enhance GHO capabilities of making capital usage more efficient.
